            1. It is truly arousing to see the invigorating and luminescent ideals of Juche flow through the bodies of these patriotic youths, 
            whose unyielding shoulders carry the the boldest dreams of our Invincible Nation into the scintillating dawn. 
            The craven imperialist warmonger dogs are envious of the purity and noble hearts of our youths, while their own impotent progeny waste away with degeneracy. 
            I weep with elation because the DPRK and Party will last one hundred thousand years.

            2. How could you not be aware of one of our great achievements?! The DPRK is the greatest country in the world and has always produced the finest of paints.
            Our schools are the finest and every young comrade knows this. You must be an imperialist pretending to be one of our glorious people.

            3.The only lie is the propaganda fed to you by the capitalist pig-dog American government. 
            Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un is generous and kind to his people. Perhaps you should return to your welfare office, capitalist puppet.
