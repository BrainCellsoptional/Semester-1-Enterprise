        HOBBIES
        <h3>
          I have a diverse range of hobbies that reflect my interests in both
          the outdoors and technology. Fishing allows me to escape into nature,
          enjoying peaceful moments by the water. On the flip side, I love
          playing video games like War Thunder and Dirt Rally, which fuel my
          competitive spirit and immerse me in thrilling virtual battles and
          exciting races. I’m also passionate about cars and military vehicles.
          I enjoy learning about the mechanics behind these machines and
          exploring their historical significance. I appreciate the stories and
          events that have shaped our past. Plus, I enjoy unwinding with friends
          over drinks, making for memorable gatherings filled with great
          conversation and camaraderie.

      <h3>
        War Thunder is an immersive multiplayer combat simulator that combines
        air, land, and sea warfare in a rich World War II and Cold War setting.
        I’ve spent nearly 1,500 hours playing this game, and it still manages to
        frustrate me every time I log in. Despite my complaints, I believe War
        Thunder is easily the greatest game ever created, even though it’s run
        by Gaijin, a company that often seems clueless about balancing the game
        for a fair and enjoyable experience. Like an abusive relationship, I
        keep coming back because the core gameplay is unmatched—there’s truly
        nothing else like it out there.

              I love getting on the piss and going fishing with the boys. 
              There’s no better feeling than hooking a massive fish after
              slamming beers for the last hour. For me, catching the fish isn’t
              even the most important part; it’s all about being out there with
              mates, enjoying the moment and the great outdoors. I haven’t had
              the best luck with the fish lately, but I know that over the
              summer, I’ll be reeling in plenty of big ones.

                I’ve owned a few “good” sports cars and quite a few shitboxes, and I’ve enjoyed every moment of them.

                When gas prices rise or I just can’t go for a drive in real life, I jump into the world of Dirt Rally 2.0. 
                It’s a fantastic rally simulator built for tearing up the roads in cars of all ages, from the terrifying Group B cars (my favorites) 
                to the modern-day monsters. Anything goes in the world of rally. I hope to one day own the cars I drive in these games.
